=head1 DESCRIPTION

Note that everything in here is experimental and subject to change.

All times are in seconds.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<real>

    my $real = $time->real;

Returns the "real" amount of time the class or method took to run.
    
=head2 C<user>

    my $user = $time->user;

Returns the "user" amount of time the class or method took to run.
    
=head2 C<system>

    my $system = $time->system;

Returns the "system" amount of time the class or method took to run.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<duration>

Returns the returns a human-readable representation of the time this class or
method took to run. Something like:

  0.00177908 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.00 CPU)
