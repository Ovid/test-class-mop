=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $tc_config = Test::Class::MOP::Config->new({
     show_timing => 1,
     builder     => Test::Builder->new,
     statistics  => 1,
     randomize   => 0,
 });
 my $test_suite = Test::Class::MOP->new($tc_config);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For internal use only (maybe I'll expose it later). Not guaranteed to be
stable.

This class defines many of the attributes for L<Test::Class::MOP>. They're
kept here to minimize namespace pollution in L<Test::Class::MOP>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 * C<show_timing>

Boolean. Will display verbose information on the amount of time it takes each
test class/test method to run.

=head2 * C<statistics>

Boolean. Will display number of classes, test methods and tests run.

=head2 * C<use_environment>

Boolean.  Sets show_timing and statistics to true if your test harness is running verbosely, false otherwise.

=head2 C<test_classes>

Takes a class name or an array reference of class names. If it is present, the
C<test_classes> method will only return these classes. This is very useful if
you wish to run an individual class as a test:

    Test::Class::MOP->new(
        test_classes => $ENV{TEST_CLASS}, # ignored if undef
    )->runtests;

=head2 C<include_tags>

Array ref of strings matching method tags (a single string is also ok). If
present, only test methods whose tags match C<include_tags> or whose tags
don't match C<exclude_tags> will be included. B<However>, they must still
start with C<test_>.

For example:

 my $test_suite = Test::Class::MOP->new({
     include_tags => [qw/api database/],
 });

The above constructor will only run tests tagged with C<api> or C<database>.

=head2 C<exclude_tags>

The same as C<include_tags>, but will exclude the tests rather than include
them. For example, if your network is down:

 my $test_suite = Test::Class::MOP->new({
     exclude_tags => [ 'network' ],
 });

 # or
 my $test_suite = Test::Class::MOP->new({
     exclude_tags => 'network',
 });


=head2 C<builder>

Usually defaults to C<< Test::Builder->new >>, but you could substitute your
own if it conforms to the interface.

=head2 C<randomize>

Boolean. Will run tests in a random order.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<args>

 my $tests = Some::Test::Class->new($test_suite->test_configuration->args);

Returns a hash reference of the args used to build the configuration. Used in
testing. You probably won't need it.

=head1 BUGS
